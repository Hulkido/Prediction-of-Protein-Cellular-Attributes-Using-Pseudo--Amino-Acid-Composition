# Prediction-of-Protein-Cellular-Attributes-Using-Pseudo--Amino-Acid-Composition
## Introduction
This paper is all about predicting attributes using Pseudo Amino Acid Composition. Since here is large variation in protein cells
and hence encoding them directly would make a huge feature vector, which is hard to incorporate into training. And hence this paper deduce a method using different type of similarity function to encode the variations in a small sized feature vector and shown improved results on prior works.
## Files
As you will read the paper you will find out different techniques to encode the variations and corresponding to these techniques we have function implemeted in matlab. There is also a main file which incorporate all these techniques in it.
